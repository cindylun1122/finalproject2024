            <p> Below is the link to UMSI students who are interested in serving as private tutors for SI courses and related content areas. UMSI maintains the directory (updated Fall/Winter semesters), but all interactions should be conducted peer-to-peer.
                In addition, UMSI does not guarantee specific results from, nor are we responsible for, tutoring services received via the peer-to-peer tutoring directory. If you have concerns regarding a tutoring experience, please email UMSI Academic
                Success at <a href="umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu">umsi.academicsuccess@umich.edu</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, students who have graduated from UMSI will be periodically removed from the list following degree conferral periods.</p>

            <p> In response to student requests, the UMSI Academic Success team is hosting a comprehensive list of students interested in providing tutoring services to their classmates. Those included as a resource for this program are current students in
                good academic standing. All services provided will be considered at-will student to student exchanges and must be in compliance with all UMSI and U-M standards of academic integrity. </p>
